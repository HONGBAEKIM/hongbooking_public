# Automatically Booking Evaluation Slots  
  
I have developed a program that automates  
the process of booking evaluation slots,  
eliminating the need to manually refresh the evaluation page.  
  
Allow me to guide you on its usage:  

## 1. Download Hongbooking  
  
[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/HONGBAEKIM/hongbooking_public/tree/main)  
  
## 2. Extract Files  
  
If the user is a 42 student:  
&#9;Extract 42student.zip  
  
If the user is a 42 piscine participant:  
&#9;Extract 42piscine.zip  
  
## 3. Run the Booking Evaluation Slots Program  
  
If the user is a 42 student:  
&#9;**./hongbooking19_student password**  
  
If the user is a 42 piscine participant:  
&#9;**./hongbooking19_piscine password**  
  
**Password** can be found at [https://www.hongpage.com/hongbooking](https://www.hongpage.com/hongbooking).  
A new password is generated every 30 minutes.  
  
## 4. Log in with your credentials (ID and password).  
  
## 5. Select the project name.  
  
## 6. Provide the desired start and end evaluation times.
