Automatically booking evaluation slots
I have developed a program that automates
the process of booking evaluation slots,
eliminating the need to manually refresh the evaluation page.

Allow me to guide you on its usage:

0.download hongbooking

zip or git clone from https://github.com/HONGBAEKIM/hongbooking_public/tree/main


1.extract file 

if (user == 42student) 
    extract 42student.zip
if (user == 42piscine) 
    extract 42piscine.zip

# 2. Run booking evaluation slots program  

if (user == 42student)
    ./hongbooking19_student <password>
if (user == 42piscine)
    ./hongbooking19_piscine <password>

#<password> is in https://www.hongpage.com/hongbooking


3.Start by logging in with your credentials (ID and password).

4.Specify the project name that you want to have evaluated.

5.Provide the desired start and end times for the evaluation.
